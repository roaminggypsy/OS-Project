This is a group project for CSCI 402 Operating Systems at USC

Due to the course policy, we can't share any code or assignment specs.

We are provided with a source and binary release of a skeletal operating system called weenix.<br/>
Most of the OS pieces are filled in but there are missing pieces.<br/>

Our implementation includes:
1) Processes and Threads 
2) Virtual File System
3) Virtual Memory
